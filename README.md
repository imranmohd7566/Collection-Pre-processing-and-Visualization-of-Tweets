## Snscrape 

snscrape is a Python library that can be used to scrape tweets through Twitter's API without any restrictions or request limits.

It really helped us to fetch large number of tweets related to trending keywords. Furthermore, we don’t even need a Twitter developer account to scrape tweets using snscrape. We fetched and stored tweets related to below keywords: 
     Altcoin 
     Bitcoin 
     Coindesk 
     Cryptocurrency 
     Gold 
     APPL 
     GOOG
